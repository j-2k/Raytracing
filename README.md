# First Raytracing Project

[Visualizing this raytracer in unity](https://github.com/j-2k/VisualizeRaytracingInUnity)
This is my first time trying to tackle raytracing from scratch, I will be documenting everything I do on my website for more information on trying to understand what is going on you can view my [website](https://j-2k.github.io) & check the projects section.

Its important to know before hand this project is not fully written from "scratch" but it kind of is atleast the raytracing part. we are mostly using a vulkan image & assigning its pixels to "emulate" a raytracer, but anyway this project is a [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut) template originally & we just built a raytracer ontop of it. Its mostly just ImGUI for UI, GLM for math, & GLFW for window stuff.

# Building this project

I used Visual Studio 2022 so I suggest that IDE, but you also need latest version of the Vulkan SDK.
