This is my first time trying to tackle raytracing from scratch, I will be documenting my learning journey on everything I do & learn on my website. I try to make it in a way that is simple to understand as much as possible, if you would like to check it out click the blog link above or click [here](https://j-2k.github.io/raytracingproject).

Its important to know before hand this project is not fully written from "scratch" but it kind of is atleast the raytracing part. we are mostly using a vulkan image & assigning its pixels to "emulate" a raytracer, but anyway this project is a [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut) template originally & we just built a raytracer ontop of it. Its mostly just ImGUI for UI, GLM for math, & GLFW for window stuff.

# Building this project

I used Visual Studio 2022 so I suggest that IDE, but you also need latest version of the Vulkan SDK.
